# firebase-import-user
Gist to import federated user account(s) into firebase through cloud functions.
This is not a working GIST. I've created it to ask the [question to Firebase team](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45755292/can-i-create-a-federated-user-in-firebase-manually-using-admin-authentication-ap/47747815#47747815).
